synopsis: "A Markdown frontend in pure OCaml."
description: """
This Markdown library is implemented using only pure OCaml (including
I/O operations provided by the standard OCaml compiler distribution).
Omd is meant to be as faithful as possible to the original Markdown.
Additionally, Omd implements a few Github markdown features, an
extension mechanism, and a few other features. Note that the opam
package installs both the Omd library and the command line tool `omd`."""
